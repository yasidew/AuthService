## 🐳 Docker Setup

The service is containerized using the following **Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/epol-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
````

### 📦 How to Build & Run Locally

1️⃣ **Build the Docker image:**

```bash
docker build -t authservice:latest .
```

2️⃣ **Run the container:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name authservice-container authservice:latest
```

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment:

* **On Push:**

  * Runs code checkout.
  * Performs SonarCloud scan.
  * Builds the Docker image.
  * Pushes the image to Docker Hub.

* **On Deploy:**

  * AWS EC2 instance (self-hosted runner) pulls the latest Docker image.
  * Stops the old container and runs the new one automatically.
